# DSA-Project-Visualization
This repository is for my Data Structure and Algorithm project. Our goal is to make a visualization program for diferent sorting algorithm and Dijkstra Algorithm.

# How to run
* In Sublime Text Editor
  * Your sublime should have same version of minGW compiler and SFML version
  * Your sublime needs to have a built system for c++ with SFML. For this edit the project and paste the text from "project_build" file attached above
* In Visual Studio
  * Create a new project and in properties add all the lib and bin files for sfml
  * Your Visual C++ and SFML should match
  * Make these files the files of your project solution

## resource
* Background images
* Fonts

## bin
* **.dll** files

## include
* **cScreen.hpp** - for managing and running all screens
* **screens.hpp** - for including all screens
* **menu.hpp** - *home* screen
* **Dijkstra.hpp** - *Dijkstra Algorithm* to find shortest distance between two coordinates
* **Quick.hpp** - *Quick Sort* and *Bubble Sort* algorithm visualization
* **credits.hpp** - show the credits and information of contributers or project member

## src
* **main.cpp** - Manages all screens--file which runs first
* **menu.cpp** - *home* screen
* **Dijkstra.cpp** - *Dijkstra Algorithm* to find shortest distance between two coordinates
* **Quick.cpp** - *Quick Sort* and *Bubble Sort* algorithm visualization
* **credits.cpp** - show the credits and information of contributers or project member

# Enjoy coding!!!
